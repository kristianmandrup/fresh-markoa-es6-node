# Routes

## RouteBuilder

`route-builder` has `buildRoute` method to build a route on the koa application.

## RouteConfig

`route-config` has `buildAll` to build all the routes from the list of active pages on the server object.

## TODO
Consider using either:
- [koa-routing](https://github.com/ivpusic/koa-routing)
- [koa-router](https://github.com/alexmingoia/koa-router)
